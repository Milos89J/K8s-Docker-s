-k8s-

First thing with K8s, is that we have Cluster services and API.
Cluster services run infrastracture in secon bloc wich call worker that is 
container HOST, those things have Kube proces, which is responsible with 
comunication with Cluster services, and we have Yaml file, and inside yaml file 
have bunch configuration. In yaml file we have deployment, pod, container image one or more. 
They have Pod number one, pod number two... When we lose one of them, workers, and Pod death, 
he change them another Pod.
Kubernetes is open sorce container, which depeloped by Google. 
Kubernetes Arhitecture 
Every node have Kubelet, is proces make his possible that Cluster talk to ich other 
and execute some tacks, like running application proces. 
API server which also container.
first, we have Node, server.
we have container, like Docker container, a we create Pod in Kubernetes, and every container have 
single Pod. Pod is layer which contains Docker Container. 
communication between Pods, means each Pods have IP address
